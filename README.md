Learning GitHub!

Hey there! Just doing this for learning purposes!

I am currently learning the basics and fundamentals, but am planning on becoming very involved in the development and open-source community. I have a very strong interest in JavaScript, particularly full stack JavaScript using node.JS and frameworks like React and Angular.

I have a goal to become a full time professional developer in the shortest amount of time possible, **without** a college degree. I have discovered that in this field, having the aptitude, intrinsic curiosity and drive to learn are more valuable than an expensive piece of paper.
